# Brain_Tumor-Detection
This project was a combination of a CNN model classification problem (to predict whether the subject has a brain tumor or not) and a computer vision problem (to automate the process of brain cropping from MRI scans). The performance could be increased by a larger number of training images or through model hyperparameter tuning.
